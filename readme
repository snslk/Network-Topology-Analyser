	NETWORK TOPOLOGY ANALYSER

To analyse a given network topology ,
I am using Matrix to store the information about each system.
Each ith row represents connections(can send msg from ith to jth node) of ith node/system with every other node present in the system.

Considering :
-> no system is connected to itself i.e. all i,j| (i=j) => M[i][j]=0 
-> all i,j | i sends message to jth node => M[i][j]=1
-> all i,j | i cannot send message to jth node => M[i][j]=0

Network topology analyser can detect following topologies:-
	1)Mesh topology
	2)Star topology
	3)Ring topology(unidirectional)
	4)Hybrid topology
	5)point to point connection
	6)no connection 

Mesh topology : 
In Mesh topology each system can send msg to every other system excluding itself(assumption) present in the network.
N = number of systems present in the Network.
Matrix of connections will be of NxN .
We can surely say that one system will send msg to (N-1) systems.So,total number of connections will be N*(N-1).
 
Star topology:
In Star topology every system sends msg to only one system that system is generally known as Hub . Hub recieves the msg and forward/send it to destination system .
N=number of systems present in the Network.
Matrix of connections will be NxN.
We can surely say that Hub can send msg to (N-1) excluding itself and rest (N-1) systems will send to only one system i.e Hub.
total number of connections will be (N-1)+(N-1)= 2N-2

Ring topology (Unidirectional) :
In Ring topology each system can send msg to some system and recieve msg from one system i.e.each system have one indegree and one outdegree .
N=number of systems in a Network.
Matrix of connection will be NxN.
total number of connections will be N.

Point to Point Connection:
there only two systems in a Network.
i.e. total number connections will be 2.

Hybrid topology : 
In Hybrid Topology systems are connected using multiple topologies .
Total number of connections > N and not equal to 0 or 2.
